# URL Submission assign submission plugin for Moodle.

## Paul Vincent, Open College of the Arts, 2021.
### Thanks to Dave Balch of University of Oxford for the Word Count plugin, which was the basis for this URL submission plugin.

A simple plugin that adds a "URL Submission" type to assignment activities.

This adds a required text box on the Edit submission page, which allows students to submit their Blog address as, or as part of, their assignment submission.
